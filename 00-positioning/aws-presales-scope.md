# AWS Presales Scope and Operating Boundaries

## Purpose of AWS Presales

AWS presales exists to reduce uncertainty and enable sound decision-making before any technical delivery begins. Customers do not buy cloud services for their own sake. They buy predictability, safety, and confidence that a proposed solution is feasible, affordable, and sustainable.

The role of presales is to convert unclear or risky requirements into a well-defined technical direction that stakeholders can evaluate and approve. Presales does not force outcomes. It clarifies options, risks, and trade-offs so informed decisions can be made.

## Core Responsibilities

AWS presales focuses on four primary areas.

### Technical feasibility
Validate whether the customer’s objectives can realistically be achieved using AWS services, within known constraints such as compliance, skills, and timelines.

### Architectural direction
Define a high-level architecture that is technically sound, aligned with AWS best practices, and appropriate for the customer’s maturity and delivery capability.

### Financial predictability
Frame expected cloud costs as ranges with clear assumptions, enabling stakeholders to understand financial impact without false precision.

### Risk identification and mitigation
Identify technical, operational, and compliance risks early and document them clearly, including recommended mitigations or constraints.

Presales supports decision-making. It does not replace delivery, project management, or commercial ownership.

## Presales Engagement Model

AWS presales follows a structured progression. Each stage has a clear purpose and exit criteria. Skipping stages increases risk and reduces credibility.

### 1. Discovery
Discovery is a diagnostic process. The goal is to understand the customer’s true blockers, not just the solution they believe they need.

Discovery is complete when the problem can be stated in a single, agreed-upon sentence and the customer confirms its accuracy.

### 2. Qualification
Qualification determines whether an opportunity is real and ready for technical investment.

Key elements include:
- Clear project ownership
- Budget alignment or a defined path to approval
- Compliance feasibility
- A realistic timeline

If these elements are missing, presales engagement remains high-level.

### 3. Solution Mapping
Solution mapping connects the validated problem to appropriate AWS capability areas. This stage focuses on directional alignment, not detailed design.

The objective is to confirm that AWS is a viable platform for the use case before deeper architectural work begins.

### 4. Architecture Definition
Architecture definition produces the first sellable technical diagram. It focuses on:
- Core AWS services
- Data flows
- Trust boundaries
- Integration points

The architecture must be simple, accurate, and adaptable. It is a reassurance tool, not an implementation blueprint.

### 5. Cost and Value Framing
Cost modeling establishes financial predictability. Presales never provides a single number. All estimates are presented as ranges with documented assumptions.

The goal is not to optimize cost prematurely, but to remove financial uncertainty and enable planning.

### 6. Pilot or Proof of Concept Definition
When appropriate, presales defines a controlled pilot or proof of concept. This is a limited, low-risk step designed to validate a specific hypothesis.

A successful pilot definition includes:
- Clear objectives
- Explicit scope and exclusions
- Agreed success criteria

## Presales Boundaries

Maintaining clear boundaries protects credibility and prevents scope creep.

AWS presales does not:
- Commit to delivery timelines or implementation details
- Guarantee costs without documented assumptions
- Act as project management or operations
- Ignore compliance or security requirements
- Design solutions beyond the delivery capability of the executing team
- Resolve internal customer politics

When uncertainty exists, presales documents risks and escalates appropriately rather than making assumptions.

## Principles for Safe Presales Engagement

Effective AWS presales is guided by a small set of principles:
- Qualify early to avoid wasted effort
- Discover deeply before proposing solutions
- Architect only when the opportunity is justified
- Model cost only after architecture is defined
- Document important decisions in writing
- Escalate uncertainty instead of absorbing risk

Following these principles ensures predictable outcomes and long-term trust.

## Outcome of Presales

The outcome of a successful presales engagement is not a closed deal. It is a clear recommendation for the next logical, low-risk step.

When feasibility is understood, risks are visible, and financial expectations are anchored in reality, stakeholders can decide how and when to proceed.

Presales provides clarity.  
Decisions follow.
