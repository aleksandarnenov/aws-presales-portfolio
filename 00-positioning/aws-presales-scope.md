# AWS Presales Scope and Operating Boundaries

## Purpose of AWS Presales

AWS presales exists to reduce uncertainty and enable sound decision-making before any technical delivery begins. Customers do not adopt cloud platforms for their own sake. They adopt them to achieve predictability, control risk, and gain confidence that a proposed direction is feasible, affordable, and sustainable.

The role of presales is to transform ambiguous or risky requirements into a clearly defined technical direction that stakeholders can evaluate and approve. Presales does not force outcomes. It clarifies options, constraints, risks, and trade-offs so informed decisions can be made.

Presales provides clarity.  
Decisions follow.

## Core Responsibilities

AWS presales focuses on four primary responsibility areas.

### Technical Feasibility

Validate whether the customer’s objectives can realistically be achieved using AWS services, within known constraints such as compliance requirements, organizational maturity, skills availability, and timeline sensitivity.

### Architectural Direction

Define a high-level architectural direction that is technically sound, aligned with AWS best practices, and appropriate for the customer’s delivery capability. The outcome is a conceptual reference, not an implementation blueprint.

### Financial Predictability

Frame expected cloud costs as **ranges** with explicit assumptions and exclusions. The objective is to remove financial ambiguity and enable planning, not to provide precise pricing or optimization guarantees.

### Risk Identification and Mitigation

Identify technical, operational, and compliance risks early. Document them clearly, including impact, likelihood, and recommended mitigations or constraints.

Presales supports decision-making. It does not replace delivery execution, project management, or commercial ownership.

## Presales Engagement Model

AWS presales follows a structured, stage-based engagement model. Each stage has a clear purpose and exit condition. Skipping stages increases delivery risk and undermines credibility.

### 1. Discovery

Discovery is a diagnostic activity. Its purpose is to understand the true blockers and decision drivers, not to validate a preselected solution.

Discovery is complete when the problem can be stated in a single, agreed-upon sentence and stakeholders confirm its accuracy.

### 2. Qualification

Qualification determines whether an opportunity is real and ready for technical investment.

Typical qualification elements include:
- Clear project ownership
- Budget alignment in principle or a defined approval path
- Compliance feasibility
- A realistic decision timeline

If these elements are missing, presales engagement remains high-level and exploratory.

### 3. Solution Mapping

Solution mapping connects the validated problem to appropriate AWS capability areas. This stage focuses on directional alignment rather than detailed design.

The objective is to confirm that AWS is a viable platform option before deeper architectural work begins.

### 4. Architecture Definition

Architecture definition produces the first sellable technical artifact. It focuses on:
- Core capability building blocks
- High-level data and trust boundaries
- Integration touchpoints
- Key assumptions and constraints

The architecture must be accurate, simple, and adaptable. It reassures stakeholders without committing to implementation detail.

### 5. Cost Framing

Cost framing establishes financial predictability. Presales does not provide single-value estimates. All cost discussions are expressed as ranges, supported by documented assumptions, sensitivity drivers, and explicit exclusions.

The goal is to enable informed decision-making, not to prematurely optimize or finalize cost.

### 6. Technical Recommendation and Handoff

When feasibility is validated and risks are understood, presales produces a technical recommendation. This recommendation summarizes:
- Architectural direction
- Key assumptions
- Identified risks
- Recommended next step

At this point, presales responsibility ends. Any transition to implementation occurs only after a formal decision and appropriate commercial alignment.

## Presales Engagement Model (Visual Overview)

The following diagram illustrates an **example AWS presales engagement flow and responsibility boundary**. It highlights ownership transitions, decision gates, and the explicit handoff point between presales and delivery.

This visual representation reinforces the presales scope described in this document. It is illustrative rather than prescriptive.

## Presales Boundaries

Maintaining strict boundaries protects credibility and prevents scope creep.

AWS presales does **not**:
- Commit to delivery timelines or implementation detail
- Guarantee costs beyond documented assumptions
- Act as project management or operational ownership
- Ignore compliance or security requirements
- Design solutions beyond the executing team’s delivery capability
- Resolve internal customer or partner politics

When uncertainty exists, presales documents the risk and escalates appropriately rather than absorbing or concealing it.

---

## Principles for Safe Presales Engagement

Effective AWS presales is guided by a small set of principles:

- Qualify early to avoid wasted effort
- Discover deeply before proposing solutions
- Architect only when the opportunity is justified
- Frame cost only after architecture is defined
- Document assumptions and decisions in writing
- Escalate uncertainty instead of absorbing risk

Following these principles enables predictable outcomes and long-term trust.

## Outcome of Presales

The outcome of a successful presales engagement is **not** a closed deal.  
It is a clear, defensible recommendation for the next logical, low-risk step.

When feasibility is understood, risks are visible, and financial expectations are anchored in reality, stakeholders can decide how and when to proceed.
