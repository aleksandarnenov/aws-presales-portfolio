# Anonymized Public-Sector AWS Presales Case Study

## Context

A public-sector organization was exploring the modernization of a legacy, document-heavy system with strict regulatory, security, and budgetary constraints. The organization had limited prior cloud experience and required high confidence in feasibility, cost predictability, and risk containment before proceeding.

The engagement occurred at an early decision-making stage. No delivery commitment existed, and the primary objective was to determine whether AWS was a viable and defensible platform for the target use case.

All details in this case study are anonymized and abstracted to demonstrate presales methodology rather than a specific customer implementation.

## Business and Technical Constraints

Key constraints identified during initial discussions included:

- Regulatory and data residency requirements
- Limited internal cloud engineering capacity
- Sensitivity to cost variability and budget overruns
- Dependency on third-party delivery partners
- A requirement for phased adoption rather than a full migration

These constraints shaped every subsequent presales activity.

---

## Presales Objectives

The presales engagement was scoped to:

- Validate technical feasibility on AWS
- Define a high-level, regulatorily defensible architecture
- Establish a realistic cost range with explicit assumptions
- Identify and document key risks and mitigation paths
- Recommend a low-risk next step rather than a full rollout

No implementation timelines or delivery commitments were defined.

## Discovery and Qualification

### Discovery

Discovery focused on identifying the true blockers rather than surface-level feature requests. Structured questioning clarified:

- The operational pain points driving urgency
- Compliance obligations influencing architecture choices
- Success criteria for an initial cloud initiative
- Organizational readiness and skill gaps

Discovery concluded once the problem statement was agreed upon and validated by stakeholders.

### Qualification

Qualification confirmed:

- Clear project ownership
- Budget alignment in principle (range-based, not fixed)
- Feasibility of compliance requirements on AWS
- Availability of a capable delivery partner

Only after qualification was confirmed did the engagement proceed to solution mapping.

## Architecture Approach (Conceptual)

A high-level AWS architecture was defined to demonstrate feasibility without overcommitting to implementation details.

The architecture focused on:

- Managed AWS services to reduce operational burden
- Clear data boundaries to support compliance requirements
- Modular components to enable phased adoption
- Security controls aligned with shared responsibility principles

The architecture was presented as a conceptual reference, not a deployment blueprint.

---

## Cost Framing Methodology

Cost modeling was approached as a decision-support tool rather than a pricing exercise.

Key principles applied:

- Costs were presented as ranges, not single values
- All estimates included documented assumptions
- Sensitivity drivers (data volume, usage growth) were highlighted
- Exclusions were explicitly stated to avoid false certainty

This approach reduced financial ambiguity and enabled informed planning discussions.

---

## Risk Identification and Mitigation

Primary risks identified included:

- Underestimation of compliance effort
- Dependency on partner delivery capability
- Organizational readiness gaps
- Potential scope expansion during implementation

Each risk was documented with a corresponding mitigation strategy or constraint, ensuring transparency.

---

## Outcome and Recommendation

The presales engagement resulted in:

- Confirmation that AWS was a feasible platform for the use case
- A shared understanding of architectural direction and constraints
- Anchored cost expectations suitable for budget planning
- A clear, low-risk recommendation for a limited pilot phase

The outcome was not a closed deal, but a defensible recommendation for the next logical step.

## Key Takeaways

This case study demonstrates how disciplined AWS presales:

- Reduces uncertainty before technical delivery begins
- Protects stakeholders from premature commitments
- Enables confident, low-risk decision-making

Presales succeeded by providing clarity, not pressure.
