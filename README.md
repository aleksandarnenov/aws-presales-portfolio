# AWS Presales Architecture Review and Decision Support

## Purpose

This repository contains presales and advisory artifacts designed to support **early-stage architecture review, feasibility assessment, and decision support** in AWS contexts.

The focus is on **improving decision quality before commitment**, helping partners and stakeholders identify constraints, cost drivers, and governance risks **before engineering resources are engaged**.

---

## Scope and Intent

This repository is intentionally limited in scope.

It includes:
- architecture viability decision trees
- assumption-based cost and risk framing tools
- governance and compliance checklists
- presales qualification frameworks

It explicitly excludes:
- implementation guidance
- delivery instructions
- production-ready architectures
- deployment templates or automation
- client-specific solutions

These materials are **not** a delivery toolkit and should not be used as implementation blueprints.

---

## Intended Audience

The content is intended for:
- AWS presales professionals
- partner architects involved in early qualification
- technical decision-makers evaluating cloud feasibility
- stakeholders responsible for cost, security, or governance oversight

It is **not** intended for hands-on engineering teams seeking build instructions.

---

## How to Use This Repository

Use these artifacts as **review and discussion tools**, not as prescriptive designs.

Typical usage includes:
- qualifying or disqualifying workloads early
- validating assumptions before migration commitments
- framing cost and licensing risks for stakeholders
- identifying governance constraints that affect feasibility

If an artifact surfaces high risk or incompatibility, the correct outcome is often **to pause or stop**, not to redesign immediately.

---

## Artifact Status and Maintenance

All artifacts in this repository are provided as **stable reference materials**.

- Status: Stable reference
- Intended use: Presales decision support
- Maintenance: No active maintenance planned
- Change control: Updates occur only when material assumptions or governance models change

There is no commitment to evolve these materials into delivery-ready assets.

## Final Note

This repository exists to support that upstream role.
