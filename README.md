# AWS Presales Portfolio

This repository presents a curated, public-safe AWS presales portfolio focused on structured discovery, solution validation, cost framing, and risk management.

It reflects how I approach AWS presales engagements in regulated, enterprise, and public-sector contexts, emphasizing clarity, predictability, and disciplined decision-making rather than delivery execution.

This portfolio is intentionally anonymized and abstracted to demonstrate methodology and thinking, not proprietary customer or employer material.

---

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

This repository illustrates how I operate across the full AWS presales lifecycle, including:

- **Translating ambiguous business needs** into clear technical problem statements
- **Qualifying opportunities** before committing deep technical effort
- **Defining high-level AWS architectures** aligned with feasibility and constraints
- **Framing cloud costs** as ranges with explicit assumptions
- **Identifying and documenting** technical, operational, and compliance risks early
- **Maintaining strict presales boundaries** to protect credibility and outcomes

The focus is on decision enablement, not implementation.

---

## What This Portfolio Intentionally Excludes

To remain safe, portable, and professionally appropriate, this repository does not include:

- Customer, partner, or employer names
- Real architectures tied to live environments
- Pricing figures, discounts, or commercial terms
- Code, infrastructure templates, or delivery artifacts
- Commitments related to timelines, SLAs, or operations

All examples are anonymized and conceptual.

## How to Navigate

- **00-positioning**  
  Defines presales scope, responsibilities, and boundaries.

- **01-case-studies**  
  Demonstrates how the presales model is applied in a realistic, anonymized scenario.

- **02-presales-templates**  
  Reusable frameworks for discovery, qualification, risk management, and technical review.

- **03-cost-modeling**  
  Methodology for establishing financial predictability without false precision.

- **04-security-and-governance**  
  Presales-level security and compliance considerations that shape architecture and feasibility.

## Intended Audience

This portfolio is intended for:

- AWS partners and distributors
- Presales and solution architecture leaders
- Recruiters evaluating senior presales capability
- Stakeholders interested in disciplined, low-risk cloud adoption

It is not a learning tutorial or a delivery reference.

## Final Note

Effective AWS presales is not about pushing technology.  
It is about removing uncertainty so the next step is obvious, low-risk, and defensible.

This repository exists to demonstrate that approach.
